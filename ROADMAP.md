# CP800 issues:

1.	flow sensors are too troublesome to adjust, 
    -	need better models?
2.	Tanks need to be more rigid:
    -	Stainless steel casing with 
        -	non-conductive surface for sensor
        -	or a fuse in sensor
    -	Strong design of print 
3.	Solenoid valves rust even when expose to moisture. 
    -	Get a model that has no direction contact between the spring and the fluid
4.	New model of CP800
    -	New chassis design
    -	Smaller volume
5.	Photo flow, and demonetized water final wash. 
    -	Last step of the process

# Future project:
1.	CP800 features:
    -	Temperature control
    -	Full error reporting 
    -	Data logging for error
    -	Deep cycle
2.	Patterson auto-loader
3.	Processing movie films
    -	A list of requirements
4.	Roller transport / pull-thru
    -	Brand new model: (include this in github)
5.	Scanner (include this in github)
    -	Graphic card fails often
    -	AI assisted processing
6.	Dip and dunk (include this in github)
    -	Advantage: Minimal physical contact with film
    -	Challenges:
        -	Large clearance if the film is long
            1.	Could dip and dunk side way, so have a long machine instead of a tall machine
        -	Auto film loader in the machine (dark). 
            1.	Clip at one end
            2.	Pull the film out
            3.	Stop when sensed the end
            4.	Clip the canister end
            5.	Load the film carrier to a hanger for transport
            6.	Start dip and dunking
        -	Manually loading to a hanger
        -	Multiple film roll process
            1.	Allow new film to be auto loaded
            2.	Only engage the loader to hanger when film loading is ready
        -	Auto transfer to scanner via a belt drive system
            1.	Unload the film carrier from the dip and dunkâ€™s transport
            2.	Roll into the scanner 
            3.	Warm air blower will dry the film as it roll into the scanner
            4.	Feed the scanned film into storage
